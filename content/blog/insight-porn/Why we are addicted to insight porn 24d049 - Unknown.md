There is self-help content thrown at us from all sides. Our Youtube feed telling us how to lose weight with this new 30 days challenge, or how we can drastically improve our sleep quality with  just these 5 simple steps. We keep clicking through this content under the illusion that it helps us achieve any of our goals. So we sit down, click through ‘insight’ videos and read ‘insight’ books but forget to take any action. My friend Jakob wrote a great article about this some weeks ago. [‘No more insight porn’](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/insight-porn). If this is not helping us achieve our goals, it begs the question, what makes this form of content so appealing? 

One, we put consuming content (learning) and taking action into the same box. Both learning about better exercising routines and actually exercising gives us a feeling that we are progressing towards the goal of getting healthier and fitter. Because it is easier to watch a video than hit the gym, we watch the video. We f**ollow the path of least resistance** to get to our goal. In this case, the goal: *‘We want to **********feel********** like we are doing something for our health’.* 

Two, when consuming content (’learning’), there is little to no risk of failure. Watching a video on ‘[7 ways to make $100k online in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDZ3M0Az8BU)’ (yes this exists), gives us a feeling that we could achieve the same. Our self-image inflates and becomes: *‘If I want to, I can become a successful internet entrepreneur*’. By not taking action, we can preserve this self-image. So we consume instead of taking action, all risk free. 

As a result, there is this huge category of ‘insight-porn’ content that we get addicted to because it is a risk free way to give us our kick. A feeling that we are making progress to one of our goals (when we are not) and a boost to our self-perception. 

Getting rid off this is difficult because it requires us to take action and risk failing. It requires a shift from taking content in because ‘it’s interesting’ to writing down specific actions that you can take. It helps to think about this as an experiment. What is the hypothesis that we want to test? How can we measure if the actions we took led to the desired outcome? 

I am convinced that insight over action bias is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome on the path to improvement in most fields.

One way I have tried to improve this for myself is to challenge myself to one experiment each week that focuses on taking action. It's called ['The Weekly Experiment Club'](https://weeklyexerimentclub.substack.com/).
